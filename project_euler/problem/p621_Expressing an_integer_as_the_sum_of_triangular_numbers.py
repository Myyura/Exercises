# Expressing an integer as the sum of triangular numbers
# Myyura

# Gauss famously proved that every positive integer can be expressed as the sum 
# of three triangular numbers (including 0 as the lowest triangular number). In 
# fact most numbers can be expressed as a sum of three triangular numbers in 
# several ways.

# Let G(n) be the number of ways of expressing n as the sum of three triangular 
# numbers, regarding different arrangements of the terms of the sum as distinct.

# For example, G(9)=7, as 9 can be expressed as: 3+3+3, 0+3+6, 0+6+3, 3+0+6, 
# 3+6+0, 6+0+3, 6+3+0.

# You are given G(1000)=78 and G(10^6)=2106.
# Find G(17526Ã—10^9).

# Since the program never stops, I write this algorithm in C++, which finally
# gave the result after running 5000 seconds.
