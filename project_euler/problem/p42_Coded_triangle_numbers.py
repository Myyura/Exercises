# Coded triangle numbers
# Myyura

# The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, 
# tn = Â½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:

# 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

# By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its 
# alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. 
# For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10. If 
# the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a 
# triangle word.

# Using words.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K 
# text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, how 
# many are triangle words?
