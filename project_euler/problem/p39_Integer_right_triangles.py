# Integer right triangles
# Myyura

# If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, 
# {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.
# {20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}
# For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?

# Basic idea:
# Solve the equation a^2 + b^2 = (p - a - b)^2, we have
#                   b = p(p - 2a) / 2(p - a)
