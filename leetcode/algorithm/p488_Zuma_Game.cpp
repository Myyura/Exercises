 *
 * Think about Zuma Game. You have a row of balls on the table, colored red(R),
 * yellow(Y), blue(B), green(G), and white(W). You also have several balls in
 * your hand.
 * 
 * Each time, you may choose a ball in your hand, and insert it into the row
 * (including the leftmost place and rightmost place). Then, if there is a
 * group of 3 or more balls in the same color touching, remove these balls.
 * Keep doing this until no more balls can be removed.
 * 
 * Find the minimal balls you have to insert to remove all the balls on the
 * table. If you cannot remove all the balls, output -1.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: board = "WRRBBW", hand = "RB"
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: WRRBBW -> WRR[R]BBW -> WBBW -> WBB[B]W -> WW
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: board = "WWRRBBWW", hand = "WRBRW"
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: WWRRBBWW -> WWRR[R]BBWW -> WWBBWW -> WWBB[B]WW -> WWWW ->
 * empty
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * Input: board = "G", hand = "GGGGG"
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: G -> G[G] -> GG[G] -> empty 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * Input: board = "RBYYBBRRB", hand = "YRBGB"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: RBYYBBRRB -> RBYY[Y]BBRRB -> RBBBRRB -> RRRB -> B -> B[B] ->
 * BB[B] -> empty 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * You may assume that the initial row of balls on the table wonâ€™t have any 3
 * or more consecutive balls with the same color.
 * The number of balls on the table won't exceed 16, and the string represents
 * these balls is called "board" in the input.
 * The number of balls in your hand won't exceed 5, and the string represents
 * these balls is called "hand" in the input.
 * Both input strings will be non-empty and only contain characters
 * 'R','Y','B','G','W'.
